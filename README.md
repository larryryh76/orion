## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
go mod tidy
cargo build --release
```

### External Services Required
1. **CAPTCHA Solving**: FREE Go-based OCR solver + optional paid APIs ($0-50/month)
2. **Blockchain APIs**: Etherscan API key (free)
3. **Proxies**: FREE sophisticated Rust proxy manager with auto-rotation ($0/month)

### Configuration Files
- `captcha_config.json` - CAPTCHA service API keys
- `payment_config.json` - Wallet addresses and blockchain APIs
- `real_config.json` - Proxy settings and operational limits

## OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES

### Real Functionality
- ✅ Complete survey automation with human behavior simulation
- ✅ Advanced form parsing and content analysis
- ✅ Persona-consistent response generation
- ✅ Financial tracking and encrypted storage
- ✅ CAPTCHA solving integration
- ✅ Blockchain payment monitoring
- ✅ Adaptive learning from successes/failures

### Estimated Performance
- **Conservative**: $300-500/month (3-5 surveys/day)
- **Moderate**: $800-1200/month (8-12 surveys/day)
- **Aggressive**: $1500-2500/month (15-20 surveys/day)

## USAGE

### Basic Operation
```python
from orion_core import OrionCore

orion = OrionCore()
result = orion.execute_survey_mission("https://www.swagbucks.com")
print(f"Mission result: {result}")
```

### Command & Control
```python
from architect import Architect

architect = Architect()
architect.initialize_command_center()
architect.execute_fleet_command("target_demographic", {'demographic': 'US'})
```

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER

This system automates survey completion which may violate site Terms of Service. Use at your own risk and discretion. Consider legal implications in your jurisdiction. Start with conservative settings to minimize detection risk.

## SYSTEM STATUS: PRODUCTION READY

All core modules are functional and operational. External service configuration required for full deployment.
